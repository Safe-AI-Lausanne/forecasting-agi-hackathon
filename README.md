## Memo
- **Data preprocessing** (`notebooks/preprocess_and_merge.ipynb`)
- **Visualization & analysis** (`notebooks/safety_benchmark_visualizations.ipynb`)
  - some benchmark does not have enough baseline datapoints (e.g. only 2 models)
  - I used the word "saturated" but it's not the exact word.

  - Argues that some safety benchmarks are naturally solved by scale and do not require effort to solve them (Bitter lesson) and are thus useless.
